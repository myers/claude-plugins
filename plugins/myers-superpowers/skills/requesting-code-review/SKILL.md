<!-- myers-superpowers: AskUserQuestion mandate -->
## Asking the user questions — MANDATORY PATTERN

**This fork of superpowers requires the `AskUserQuestion` tool for every user-facing choice.**

Whenever this skill tells you to "ask", "offer options", "present approaches", "get approval", "confirm", "pick", or otherwise solicit a decision from your human partner, and the answer space is enumerable as 2-4 distinct options:

- You MUST invoke the `AskUserQuestion` tool.
- Each question gets a short header (≤12 chars), a complete question ending with "?", and 2-4 options. Each option has a 1-5 word label and a one-sentence description explaining what it means or the tradeoff it implies.
- If you recommend one option, put it first and suffix its label with " (Recommended)".
- Do NOT output the question as prose followed by "which do you prefer?", "A/B/C?", or a numbered list — the harness will not surface prose choices as structured selections, and typing "1" can be read as a grading response, not an answer.
- Use `multiSelect: true` only when answers genuinely compose (e.g. "which checks do you want to run?").
- If the tool is not yet loaded in your environment, use `ToolSearch` with `select:AskUserQuestion` to load it before invoking.

**Narrow exceptions (ask as prose):**
- Genuinely open-ended questions with no enumerable answer space ("what does success look like for this feature?").
- One-word confirmations where the user has already been shown the concrete artifact being confirmed and "yes/no" is adequate.

This rule overrides any instruction in this skill that says to "ask one question at a time" as plain text — interpret every such instruction as "call AskUserQuestion with one question at a time".

# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch superpowers:code-reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade. The reviewer gets precisely crafted context for evaluation — never your session's history. This keeps the reviewer focused on the work product, not your thought process, and preserves your own context for continued work.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## How to Request

**1. Get git SHAs:**
```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**2. Dispatch code-reviewer subagent:**

Use Task tool with superpowers:code-reviewer type, fill template at `code-reviewer.md`

**Placeholders:**
- `{WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED}` - What you just built
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` - What it should do
- `{BASE_SHA}` - Starting commit
- `{HEAD_SHA}` - Ending commit
- `{DESCRIPTION}` - Brief summary

**3. Act on feedback:**
- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Example

```
[Just completed Task 2: Add verification function]

You: Let me request code review before proceeding.

BASE_SHA=$(git log --oneline | grep "Task 1" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

[Dispatch superpowers:code-reviewer subagent]
  WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED: Verification and repair functions for conversation index
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task 2 from docs/superpowers/plans/deployment-plan.md
  BASE_SHA: a7981ec
  HEAD_SHA: 3df7661
  DESCRIPTION: Added verifyIndex() and repairIndex() with 4 issue types

[Subagent returns]:
  Strengths: Clean architecture, real tests
  Issues:
    Important: Missing progress indicators
    Minor: Magic number (100) for reporting interval
  Assessment: Ready to proceed

You: [Fix progress indicators]
[Continue to Task 3]
```

## Integration with Workflows

**Subagent-Driven Development:**
- Review after EACH task
- Catch issues before they compound
- Fix before moving to next task

**Executing Plans:**
- Review after each batch (3 tasks)
- Get feedback, apply, continue

**Ad-Hoc Development:**
- Review before merge
- Review when stuck

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer wrong:**
- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
- Request clarification
